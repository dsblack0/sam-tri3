# 2020 Practice MC

## Score: 32/40

## Reflection
- Still make sure to read the code very carefully, especially specific conditions in for loops and if statements, to avoid misunderstanding the code
- It was helpful to map out/write out the logic of the code with an example input to see how it running
- Topics to Review
     - recursion
     - Exception Handling

My Answer: I and II only

Correct Answer: I only

Explanation: In option II, the `(double) (2 / 4)` part casts the integer 0 to a double, giving the double 0.0 and a final result of 3.0, not the desired 3.5

**Question 11**

Explanation: The decrement of `num` is run after `num` is printed in the choice I chose, so the integer 10 will also be printed which is not desired. The correct answer, runs the decrement first so it does not print and does print the integer 1 by decreasing `num` by 1 when it is equal to 2.

**Question 12**

My Answer: I only

Correct Answer: II only

Explanation: The method call I chose would run a NullPointerException when there is no Person object assigned to borrower. Option II checks if the borrower has a referene to an object when it is used in the `println`.

**Question 14**

My Answer: I only

Correct Answer: I and III only

Explanation: III will return the desired String directly when the specific condition is met so there is no issue with `cat` being overwritten. After the condition is met and the desired String is returned, the rest of the method will not run.

**Question 16**

My Answer:
           *****
           ****
           ***
           **

Correct Answer:
                **
                ***
                ****
                *****

Explanation: The recursive call of `stars(num-1)` before the for loop is run so the the loop to print the stars is run in the order of stars(2), stars(3), stars(4), stars(5)

**Question 25**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70492417/165581335-a554eb6b-2072-4e56-9846-6528343441db.png)

My Answer: "elppa"

Correct Answer: "lppa"

Explanation: The for loop starts with `i` being at 5 - 1 = 4. This means that the first substring that is added to `temp` is `str.substring(3, 4)` which is "l", not "e".

**Question 31**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70492417/165582411-10d9d176-69d8-4785-bb4d-45fb484b9907.png)

My Answer: I and III only

Correct Answer: I only

Explanation: Because option III uses an enhanced for loop so `i` represents the integer in the array `nums`, not the index. This makes the if statement not run properly.

**Question 39**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70492417/165582942-d99dbd90-136a-45fb-9030-5f108c96b18f.png)

My Answer: recurMethod("abcde")

Correct Answer: recurMethod("edcba")

Explanation: The second if statement is comparing the first to characters in the String and checking if the first is lexicographically greater than the second. In order for the method to return true, the inputted String must have characters that are arranged from lexiographically greatest to smallest. "edcba" is the only one that follows this.
