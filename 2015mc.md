My Answer: x || y

Correct Answer: x

Explanation: 
When x is true, the statement is 
(true || y) && true → true && true → true → x 
When x is false & y is true, the statement is
(false || true) && false → true && false → false → x 
When x is false & y is false, the statement is
(false || false) && false → false && false → false → x

My Answer: {17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41}

Correct Answer: {17, 20, 21, 42, 45, 69, 48, 51, 39}

Explanation:
The loop starts at the index of 1 and replaces every 3rd value from there with three from than the value at the previous index. I didn’t notice that the increment for the loop was k+x and thought it was k++.

**Question 19**

My Answer: I only

Correct Answer: I, II, and III

Explanation:
The loop will always print nothing because the if statement to print x requires x to be divisible by 2 but x starts at 1 and is increased by increments of 2. From this, (I) prints nothing because the loop doesn’t run but (II) and (III) also don’t print anything because although the loop is run, the condition of the if statement is never met.

My Answer: A value that occurs most often in nums

Correct Answer: An index of a value that occurs most often in nums.

Explanation:
The method returns index, which is the index of the value, not the value itself. I mainly just did not read the answer choices fully and properly for this question.

**Question 21**

Correct Answer:
	WATC

Explanation:
str.substring(a, b) returns a substring that starts at index a and goes up to the index b but doesn’t actually include the character at index b . Due to this str.substring(0, len-1) returns a substring starting from the first letter and ending with the second to last letter.

Explanation:
The first for loop iterates through the columns and the second for loop iterates through the row. This means that n is the actual value in the 2D array, going through a row which is what’s needed for the desired output. I mixed up the rows and columns for this.

**Question 26**

My Answer: 0 0 0 0 0 6 blackboard

Correct Answer: 1 2 3 4 5 6 blackboard

Explanation: 
When the changeIt method ran, since it was fully static, everything only changed locally but nothing actually changed in the main. With arr = new int[5], we aren’t changing the value by reference but instead are creating a new array locally.

**Question 28**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70492417/165094334-046b8a60-b1a0-4585-8ba7-89f57e7a924a.png)

My Answer: 15 / 0

Correct Answer: 15/5

Explanation:
A value is assigned to temp regardless of whether the values need to be switched. Since a value is assigned to temp after the outer for loop completely runs, the number of assignments is equal to the number of times the outer for loop runs, which is 5.

**Question 35**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70492417/165094369-2e567ba1-bd9b-4a33-992c-cb346757ff35.png)

My Answer: 8

Correct Answer: 5

Explanation:
When the while loop runs a second time, mid is set to index 4, which is the value of 5, and since 5 is less than 8, the start becomes index 5 which has a value of 8 that is equal to the target of 8. The mid that is returned is equal to this index of 5, not the value of 8, so 5 is returned.

**Question 36**
<continuing from Question 35>

My Answer: 1000
Correct Answer: 11

Explanation:
The statement will be run the most number of times if the target is the last element in the array. This means that when the midpoint is found, dividing the array into 2 parts, the number of elements being looked at will go from 2000 → 1000 → 500 → 250 → 125 → 62 → 31 → 15 → 7 → 3 → 1. That totals to running the statement 11 times.

**Question 39**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70492417/165094406-86bc01be-5254-42a3-8220-bbf805c1293c.png)

My Answer:

	Alex Alex Alex
  
	Alex Alex Alex
  
Correct Answer:

	Alex Bob Carl
  
	Alex Alex Alex

Explanation:
The set method for ArrayLists not only replaces the element at a certain index with a new one, but also returns the element that was previously at that index. This means that the first print statement will print the returned previous elements of Alex, Bob, and Carl.

## Reflection:
- Make sure to read the entire code and all of the answer choices thoroughly before answering to not miss any important information.
- Pay close attention to the logical flow of the code
- Specific topics to review:
- Boolean expressions (truth tables)
     - .substring() method
     - types of variables
